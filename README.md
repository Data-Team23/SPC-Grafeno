# Contexto
[SPC Grafeno](https://spcgrafeno.com.br/)
 You've been hired by a financial asset registrar to create innovative new financial products using machine learning techniques. The company will provide a diverse database, containing historical information on a variety of financial assets, transactions and market behaviors. Its challenge is to explore this database, identify patterns and opportunities, and develop one or more financial products that can add value to both the company and its customers.
 You will be expected to use machine learning techniques to predict trends, identify risks or even propose methods for qualifying assets. Your solution must be implemented in a proof of concept that demonstrates the viability of the proposed feasibility of the proposed product, including a description of the model used, justification for the techniques used and an evaluation of the model's performance.
 At the end, you must present your results in a report, accompanied by a presentation that explains clearly and objectively how your solution can be used by the company and what benefits it can bring to the registrar and its customers.

## User Stories
- [x] As a Front-end Developer, I want to create a user data editing interface so that administrators can easily update user information.
- [x] As a Front-end Developer, I want to create an interface for registering new users in the system so that administrators can add new users in an intuitive and secure way.
- [x] As a Back-end Developer, I want to implement the user deletion operation in the system so that it is possible to remove user profiles that should no longer be in the system.
- [x] As a Back-end Developer, I want to implement the user creation operation in the system so that users can be correctly registered with all necessary validations, allowing the inclusion of new profiles in the system.
- [x] As a Front-end Developer, I want to implement the user deletion functionality in the system so that administrators can remove user profiles that are no longer needed.
- [x] As a Front-end Developer, I want to create an interface that lists all users in the system with filtering and search functionalities so that administrators can view and manage existing user profiles.
- [x] As a Back-end Developer, I want to implement the user reading operation so that it is possible to list, view, and obtain details of user profiles registered in the system.
- [x] As a SPC User, I want to have proper handling of my database so that it is possible to increase the likelihood of success for my machine learning model.
- [x] As a SPC User, I want to have a dashboard for analyzing data that includes client analysis so that it is possible to understand how our transaction metrics are performing.
