# Contexto
[SPC Grafeno](https://spcgrafeno.com.br/)
 You've been hired by a financial asset registrar to create innovative new financial products using machine learning techniques. The company will provide a diverse database, containing historical information on a variety of financial assets, transactions and market behaviors. Its challenge is to explore this database, identify patterns and opportunities, and develop one or more financial products that can add value to both the company and its customers.
 You will be expected to use machine learning techniques to predict trends, identify risks or even propose methods for qualifying assets. Your solution must be implemented in a proof of concept that demonstrates the viability of the proposed feasibility of the proposed product, including a description of the model used, justification for the techniques used and an evaluation of the model's performance.
 At the end, you must present your results in a report, accompanied by a presentation that explains clearly and objectively how your solution can be used by the company and what benefits it can bring to the registrar and its customers.
